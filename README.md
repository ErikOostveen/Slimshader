# Slimshader
SLIMSHADER is an Open Source Raspberry PI project based on glslViewer and capable of displaying plain images and OpenGL/GLSL shader files.

Shaders are small programs that leverage the power of the GPU to display modern graphics simulations. Visit <a href="https://glslsandbox.com/" target="_blank">www.glslsandbox.com</a> to view shaders created by hundreds of artists(c).

SLIMSHADER can display these shaders(d) and modulate them by means of;
<br/>&#9642; Audio
<br/>&#9642; MIDI
<br/>&#9642; Manually tweaking dials
<br/>&#9642; Built-in LFOs (Low frequency Oscillators)
<br/>&#9642; Control Voltage (0 to 5V or 0 to 1V)

SLIMSHADER is a Eurorack format design with HDMI and Analog video output for people who like to add visuals to their music, for video-synth enthusiasts or anyone looking to learn and play with shaders files.
