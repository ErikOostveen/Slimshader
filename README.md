SLIMSHADER is an Open Source Raspberry PI(a) project based on glslViewer(b) and capable of displaying plain images and OpenGL/GLSL shader files.

Shaders are small programs that leverage the power of the GPU to display modern graphics simulations. Visit <a href="https://glslsandbox.com/" target="_blank">www.glslsandbox.com</a> to view shaders created by hundreds of artists(c).

SLIMSHADER can display these shaders(d) and modulate them by means of;
<br/>&#9642; Audio
<br/>&#9642; MIDI
<br/>&#9642; Manually tweaking dials
<br/>&#9642; Built-in LFOs (Low frequency Oscillators)
<br/>&#9642; Control Voltage (0 to 5V or 0 to 1V)

SLIMSHADER is a Eurorack format design with HDMI and Analog video output for people who like to add visuals to their music, for video-synth enthusiasts or anyone looking to learn and play with shaders files.

(a) Tested with the Raspberry PI Zero W, Zero 2 W and 3b (v1.2).
<br>(b) Patricio Gonzalez Vivo & Jen Lowe, authors of <a href="https://www.thebookofshaders.com" target="_blank">The book of shaders.</a>
<br>(c) Please note that the SLIMSHADER Raspberry PI image file comes with hundreds of shader files. Credits go out to all the makers of these shaders; their names can often be found in the header of the shader file itself.
<br>(d) Complicated shaders typically require much more CPU/GPU power and a Raspberry PI is not always able to deliver unfortunately - please keep that in mind.

Please make sure to check out the design's full description on my website: <a href="https://www.erikoostveen.co.uk/Slimshader.html" target="_blank">Slimshader Description</a>

You'll need a 16GB Micro SD card.
